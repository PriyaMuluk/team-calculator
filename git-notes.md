git fetch: This command downloads new commits, branches, and updates from the remote repository to your local repository, but it does not change your working files or current branch. It just updates your remote-tracking branches (like origin/master) so you can review what has changed before integrating.

git pull: This command does two things: it first runs git fetch to get the latest changes from the remote, and then it automatically merges those changes into your current local branch, updating your working files.

In short, fetch updates your knowledge of the remote repository without affecting your local work, while pull updates your local branch by downloading and merging the remote changes in one step.
